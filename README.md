# SharkFeed

SharkFeed is an iOS project done in Objective C that fetches images from Flickr's API.

Fresh images are downloaded in the background, cached locally and displayed in an infinitely scrolling collection view.

SharkFeed also features a lightbox view of each image, as well as the ability to save a photo to your camera roll library.
